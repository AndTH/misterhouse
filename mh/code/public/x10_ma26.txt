From Kevin Olande on 4/6/00

I recently bought a DVD Anywhere (an OK device, but that's another topic).
With it came a MP3 remote and receiver base.  It's like a universal remote
plus X10 transmitter, plus a PC based software controller.  I don't have
one, but it sounds funciotnally similar to X10's Mouse Remote, but it has
no pass though serial connector.  I noticed the base (MR26A) was receiving
all X10 RF traffic, as well as RF traffic from the MP3 remote UR51A.  So I
wrote some MH code the decrypt the signals.

My thinking is this, the PLC protocol is very quickly overloaded if
simultaneous lighting control, motion sensor, MP3 control, .... traffic is
present.  Using this device, I'll be able to get some of that traffic off
the power line and directly to the PC, this should lighten the PLC load and
improve responsiveness (since I don't have to go from Palm Pad to TM751 to
CM11A to MH, I can now go from Palm Pad to MR26A to MH, for example.)

The code isn't done yet (of course), but I thought I'd post what I had so
far.  The code doesn't change any state within MH yet, it just reports the
information received/relayed by the MR26A.

Also, I don't know what the range on the MR26A is yet, I hit it from my
basement to attic (2.5 story house) a while ago, but haven't looked into it
since (if this is a problem, maybe a slight hardware mod would help.)

If anyone has a Mouse Remote this code won't work  (different protocol),
but a similar approach may.

I'll post more code as I finish (this was a fairly quick hack so expect
change), or Bruce is there some where else I should put the code, instead
of the mail list?

Have fun.

Kevin
