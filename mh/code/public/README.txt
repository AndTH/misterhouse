mh/code/public:

This directory has working, ready to use, applications.  Unlike the 
code snippets in the code/examples directory, these files are typically
more complex, functioning code.

mh/code/public/Nick:

This is an example of a bare bones setup that we set up for Bruce's son Nick.
With tk turned off, and with few events, it consumes very little of Nick's 
valuable gaming computer resources ;)  Nick uses it in his room to control
a few lights and his mp3 player.  Bruce likes it cause he can then have 
his version of MisterHouse turn off Nick's music after hours :)
