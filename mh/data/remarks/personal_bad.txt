You wuss, you hit like a gnome!
Did you just cut the cheese?
What, you call that music? I could do better with a Sound Blaster Pro!
What is wrong with your head? Oh, that's your hair? Eww!
You'll be living in a van down by the river!
You could get a job in politics.
I could wear an I Mac case and look better than you in those clothes!
Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of your bed today.
Can I recomend a new hair stylist?  How about John Luke Pick ard.
Did you forget to shower last month?
I always wondered what ugly ment.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be mean.  Its just, you look so awful.
Does your face hurt?  Its killing me.
My calculator could whip your computer
