Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.

It's easy to sit and scoff at an old man's folly. But also, check out his Adam's apple!

I hope life isn't a big joke because I don't get it.
