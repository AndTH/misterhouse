<H1><A NAME="1_MisterHouse_operational_quest">1: MisterHouse operational questions</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_1_What_OSes_can_it_run_on_">1.1: What OSes can it run on?</A></H2>
<P>
It has been tested on Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and 2K. On Unix, it has been
run on Linux, AIX, and Sun.

</P>
<P>
In theory, any OS that runs perl should be able to run mh. In practice,
some platforms will likely have strange Serial Interfaces (e.g. Mac?), so
the Serial IO related function would take some work.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_2_How_can_I_make_it_run_faste">1.2: How can I make it run faster and use less memory?</A></H2>
<P>
On my Celron 400 Mhz computer running Windows 98, using 60 code files with
6000 lines of code, mh takes 10% the cpu, running at 9 passes per second
and using about 20 MB of memory. 

</P>
<P>
If you are happy with the Web interface and don't need the Tk interface,
turn it off by editing the Tk mh.ini parm or run:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -tk 0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If you want the tk window, but don't use the Command/Items/Group pull down
menus, try:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -tk_comands 0 -tk_items 0 -tk_groups 0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You can turn off the tk 'eye' that bounces back and forth by deleting the
tk_eye.pl code file.

</P>
<P>
You can speed up / slow down mh, using more/less cpu, by mh.ini sleep_time
parm. 

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_3_How_can_I_easily_upgrade_to">1.3: How can I easily upgrade to the latest version of mh?</A></H2>
<P>
Point your mh.ini code_dir, data_dir, and html_dir parms to somplace other
than your mh path. Then you should be able to rename your old mh directory
and unzip the new one in its place without loosing anything. Also keep your
mh.private.ini somewhere else (see next question).

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_4_How_does_mh_ini_work_">1.4: How does mh.ini work?</A></H2>
<P>
All the entries in mh.ini are read on mh Startup and on a Reload. They are
stored in the <CODE>%config_parms</CODE> array. So, for example, if you
added:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  myparm1=a b c
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Then, mh would set $config_parms{myparm1} = 'a b c';

</P>
<P>
These parms also defined what are legal startup values, so if you want to
try a different value, instead of editing your mh.ini, you can run:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  mh -myparm1 'd e f'
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Rather then edit the default mh.ini file, the best approach is to copy just
the parms you want to change to your own .ini file (e.g. mh.private.ini),
then set the environmental variable mh_parms to point where you keep that
file (see the header of mh/bin/mh.ini for more detail).

</P>
<P>
While the <CODE>%config_parms</CODE> array IS refreshed on a mh Reload,
some parms are only used on mh startup (e.g. http_port), so will only be
reloaded when you re-start mh.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_5_Can_I_run_run_mh_in_a_fast">1.5: Can I run run mh in a 'fast debug mode'?</A></H2>
<P>
Funny you should ask :) Check out the time_start, time_stop, and
time_increment parms in the mh.ini file. Here are some examples:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -time_start 0 -time_stop 24 -tk 0 -voice_text 0
   mh -time_start &quot;6 AM&quot; -time_stop &quot;11 PM&quot;  -time_increment 1
   mh -time_start &quot;5/14 7:10&quot; -time_stop &quot;5/15 10 PM&quot; -time_increment 300
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_6_How_are_the_X10_and_Serial_">1.6: How are the X10 and Serial Items implemented, indpendent of the platform?</A></H2>
<P>
This answer is authored by Bill Birthisel, author of the SerialPort and
CommPort modules.

</P>
<P>
The user works with an X10_Item which reflects physical hardware and the
state of that hardware. The user ``loop'' code deals with the state and
conditions which alter it. This code is independent of OS and specific to
mh.

</P>
<P>
X10_Items talk to Serial_Items which implement a software protocol required
by the model and type of the actual hardware. The Serial_Items can use
protocol translator modules such as CM11.pm, HomeBase.pm, and CM17.pm. But
the output is platform-independent serial commands to the next layer. The
protocol translator modules are publicly available outside mh and may be
used by code other than Serial_Items. These modules will eventually be on
CPAN. The code is still independent of OS. Other Serial_Item types,
including ``generic'' read/write ports, also exist.

</P>
<P>
Win32::SerialPort.pm and Device::SerialPort.pm are CPAN modules which
actually implement the serial command interface. Device::SerialPort is a
clone of its Win32 cousin. These modules handle high-level OS issues
including device names, configuration files, and validation of port
settings.

</P>
<P>
Each also calls a CPAN module to handle low-level interfacing to the OS and
the serial driver: Win32API::CommPort.pm or POSIX.pm (you guessed correctly
;-)

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_7_mh_seems_way_too_complicate">1.7: mh seems way too complicated.  How can I run something simple?</A></H2>
<P>
Copy mh\code\test\test_x10.pl into your own code dir (e.g. c:\mh_code).
Then run:

</P>
<P>
mh -code_dir c:\mh_code

</P>
<P>
You can then use <A HREF="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</A>
for control. If you also want the local Tk windows, also copy the tk* code
files.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_8_Is_there_a_way_I_can_have_d">1.8: Is there a way I can have direct X10 control with a simple perl script?</A></H2>
<P>
If all you want to do is control X10 devices with a cron job or from your
own cgi scripts, running mh is probably overkill. You can send X10 commands
using either the ActiveHome interface (CM11) or the cheaper Firecracker
interface (CM17) using the modules and documentation found in
mh/lib/site/ControlX10 or download them from CPAN. Examples can be found in
mh/lib/site/test_cm11.pl and test_cm17.pl.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_9_Can_I_send_mh_commands_from">1.9: Can I send mh commands from other programs?</A></H2>
<P>
You can send mh commands (Voice_Cmd text strings) from other programs in
one of 3 ways:

</P>
<P>
- Write commands to the file specified in the mh.ini xcmd_file parm. By
default this is mh/house_cmd.txt. See mh/bin/house and mh/bin/house.bat for
examples.

</P>
<P>
- Use mh/bin/mhsend to send commands via sockets (can be over the
internet). If you have run mh/bin/set_password, the mhsend -password parm
is required. To enable this, include the code mh/test/code/mhsend_server.pl
in your code directory.  

</P>
<P>
You can also control mh remotely via email (see faq question 'Can do I send
mh comands via email?'), telnet sessions (if running
mh/code/test/telent.pl), and via the built in web server.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_11_How_can_I_debug_a_problem_">1.11: How can I debug a problem?</A></H2>
<P>
Lots of debug errata can be controled with the mh -debug switch. Most of
this code is probably meaningful only if you dig into the source code, so
most people probably will not use it unless you are generating debug to
send to the author. To create a log file with debug in it, run:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  mh -log debug.log -debug xyz
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Where xyz can be any of the following:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  X10    
  serial 
  socket
  startup
  homebase
  misc
  http
  port_name of socket port
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_12_How_can_I_debug_time_event">1.12: How can I debug time event problem?</A></H2>
<P>
One way is to create a code member that contains just the event you are
trying to debug, then run mh on just that one member. For example, create a
member called \temp\test_time.pl with this code:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  print &quot;min=$Minute\n&quot; if $New_Minute;
  print &quot;hour=$Hour\n&quot;  if $New_Hour;
  print &quot;debug1 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;11:59 PM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug2 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;23:59&quot;;
  print &quot;debug3 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;12:00 AM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug4 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;00:00&quot;;
 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Then run mh using these parameters:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  mh -code_dir \temp -tk 0 -time_start '12/15 11:58 pm' -time_start '12/16 12:01 am'
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Note, you can run this test mh quickly without stoping your normal mh.  

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_13_What_are_the_advantages_di">1.13: What are the advantages/disadvantages to running the compiled versions of mh?</A></H2>
<P>
Advantages:

</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
You don't need the latest version of perl installed

</P>
<LI>
<P>
You don't have to install additional perl modules

</P>
</UL>
<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>
For some reason, starting mh with the compiled versions is slower. On my
windows box, it is 10 seconds -vs- 20 seconds.

</P>
<LI>
<P>
You can apply quick patches to mh, -vs- downloading a larger, less
frequently updated mh.exe file.

</P>
</UL>
<P>
The memory and cpu used, once mh is started, is the same.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_14_How_does_mh_read_and_use_t">1.14: How does mh read and use the user code in code_dir</A></H2>
<P>
Each time mh is started or a Reload is done, mh will re-read all the .pl
code members in the code_dir directory (this is a mh.ini parm) and the file
code_dir/mh_temp.user_code is created. All of the objects and global
variables (see FAQ question 2.4), are put at top of this file, and
everything else is put in seperate subroutines, one for each file read. A
<CODE>&amp;loop_code</CODE> subroutine is also created (at the very bottom
of mh_temp.user_code), that calls each member subroutine.

</P>
<P>
After creating this file, mh runs the perl eval function on its contents.
This re-creates all the objects, global variables, and code_dir member
subroutines. Then mh goes back into its normal loop where it queries
various input data (e.g. serial, tcp/ip, voice, time), updates objects and
variables, evals the <CODE>&amp;loop_code</CODE> code (it does an eval,
rather then execute it directly, so we can trap errors and not kill mh),
sleeps for a bit, then repeats.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_15_How_can_I_control_mh_from_a">1.15 How can I control mh from a non-mh web server like Apache?</A></H2>
<P>
You can think of the built in mh web server as 2 parts:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> - The part that auto-generates web pages that reflect your items and commands.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> - The part that responds to commands you give it via URLs.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You don't really have to use the first part. Some mh users custom generate
their own mh pages, to be served by the mh server or by a different server.
This allows for full control of what is on the web control page and how it
looks.

</P>
<P>
There is more (probably not so easy to read) documentation on how to do
this under 'Customizing the Web Interface' in mh/docs/mh.html

</P>
<P>
You can also use something like mh/code/test/mhsend_server.pl and then
read/write to sockets directly from non-mh web server cgi scripts. Or have
the web server script simply call mh/bin/mhsend to run mh commands.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="1_16_Is_there_a_front_end_tool_f">1.16 Is there a front-end tool for defining/editing mh items/events?</A></H2>
<P>
Not yet, but you can now define items/events in a table-like format. This
should allow us to enable a gui or web based front end tools for editing.  

</P>
<P>
Currently we have defined just one format defined, creativly named A, but
other formats (e.g. XML) should be easy to implement.

</P>
<P>
To use, create one or more *.mht (mh table) files in your code directory,
specifying the table format with Format=A at the top of the table. Then mh
will process (on starup and reload) each record with
mh/lib/read_table_A.pl, to create *.mhp (mh processed) files, which are
then processed with all your other mh *.pl code files.

</P>
<P>
Examples are in mh/code/bruce/*.mht and mh/code/test/*.mht. If you want to
create another table format, all you need to do is create a
mh/lib/read_table_xyz.pl member, then set Format=xyz.

</P>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="2_MisterHouse_coding_questions">2: MisterHouse coding questions</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2_1_How_do_I_debug_syntax_error">2.1: How do I debug syntax errors in my code?</A></H2>
<P>
If there are syntax errors in your code, most of them will be caught on
startup or reload. The error, and (hopefully) relevant code member and/or
line number, will show up in your console, and if running Tk, in a Tk
window on reload.

</P>
<P>
When you go to write new code, first start mh with old code that works,
then edit or copy in your new code and do a mh Reload. Fixing errors with
code Reloads is much quicker than trying to fix them on mh startup. You can
add/delete the .pl suffix on code members between reloads to enable/disable
them.

</P>
<P>
Some errors (e.g. too few/many {} around code) will point to a misleading
line number. In these cases, if you can not find the file with the error,
you can try a new option: mh -error_by_file 1 . This will try loading one
file at a time untill the error is found, but it runs pretty slow and may
not work with members that have # noloop directives.

</P>
<P>
Some errors will only show up after mh triggers events. The first time this
happens, a console/tk message will be displayed, and a message spoken.
Since these errors might happen on sequential passes of mh, subsequent
errors are only listed in the console window. If more than 10 occur,
another window is displayed, and the code member there error was in is
disabled.

</P>
<P>
All of these on-the-fly errors are logged in the file mh_temp.error_log in
your code directory. This is useful if you are not running tk and the error
has scrolled out of your console window.

</P>
<P>
You can enable the perl diagnostics module (same as perl -w) to get
additional warnings on potential coding errors. Either use mh -diagnostics
1 or set diagnostics=1 in your mh.ini. This takes about 1 meg more of
memory and causes mh to run about 10% slower, but the messages it displays
often point to valid problems. To simplify coding, the 'uninitialized
value' warnings disabled in the user code processing.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2_2_How_should_I_code_events_th">2.2: How should I code events that should occur only at infrequently, or 
only at Startup?</A></H2>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>$Startup</CODE> or <CODE>$Reload</CODE> variables for
events that should only occur when mh is Started, or when code is Reloaded.
Note that <CODE>$Reload</CODE> is also true when <CODE>$Startup</CODE> is
true.

</P>
<P>
To run events infrequently, you can use the modulus operator (%),
$New_Second/Hour/Day/Month/Year variables, or the Time_Now/Time_Cron
functions to control events.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>$New_xxx</CODE> variables are 1 (true) for each pass that the xxx
variable gets incremented, and 0 for all other passes. For example,
<CODE>$New_Hour</CODE> is true for one pass when <CODE>$Hour</CODE> changes
from one hour to another.

</P>
<P>
Here are some examples:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  print_log &quot;Only at startup&quot; if $Startup;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  print_log &quot;Every 5 minutes&quot; if $New_Minute and !($Minute % 5);
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  print_log &quot;At 10:05 pm&quot; if time_now '10:05 PM';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  print_log &quot;Every weekday at 2:15 am&quot; time_cron '2 15 * * 1-5';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2_3_How_should_I_structure_my_P">2.3: How should I structure my Perl code?</A></H2>
<P>
Pretty much anyway you want! You may want to put object definitions all in
one member (e.g. mh/code/Bruce/items.pl) so you can easily change device
codes, or you may want to define the objects in the file members you use
them in.

</P>
<P>
If the same object is defined in multiple members, it will still work ok,
although some object types (e.g. Voice_Item) will warn about duplicate
names.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2_4_Can_I_create_global_variabl">2.4: Can I create global variables that can be shared between code members?</A></H2>
<P>
Yep. All objects definitions (e.g. <CODE>$light</CODE> = new
<CODE>X10_Item('C5'))</CODE> are always shared. They are pulled out of the
member loop by mh.

</P>
<P>
All other variable declarations must be made using with 'my' or 'use vars':

</P>
<P>

If you code a 'my' or 'use var' record that starts in column 1, mh will
pull these records out of the member loop code (as it did with object
definitions), so that the variable can now be shared with other code
members.

<P>
If the 'my' or 'use var' record does not start in column 1, the variable
declaration is left in with the rest of the member code and is local to
that member.

If you want to use the variable with any mh/web/*.pl script when creating
mh web pages, you must use 'use vars', as 'my' variables can not be shared

<P>
Sometimes you may need to have mh run code out of the loop code. For

read from a file. Since objects are moved out of the loop code by mh, we
need to also move any other code used to define that object.

You can tell mh to do this using '# noloop=start/stop' comments. For

Out of the box, mh defaults to running all the code in the mh/code/test
directory. Once you have played around with the example code, you will want
to create your own code directory (probably somewhere other than in
mh/code, so you can easily upgrade to new versions of mh), and copy just
the code members you find useful. Members test_tagline and the hello_speak
members are the main sources of the periodic test speech.

<P>
Answer complements of Brent L Johnson.

</P>
<P>
The problem is, festival or another sound program, is locking your dsp
device. The sound drivers that come stock in the Linux kernel do not allow
more than one program to access the /dev/dsp at one time. If you are using
RedHat, you can use ESD to multiplex the soundcard usage. The problem is,
not all sound programs are esd aware. Festival and Viavoice do not directly
support esd. ESD does have a workaround that _sometimes_ works with non-esd
aware programs. Try starting your sound programs, festival and viavoice
under esddsp. For example: ``esddsp festival --server &amp;''. I had some
success with this route but it doesn't always work because of sampling
rates and such. 

</P>
<P>
The best fix would be to replace OSS with ALSA. <A
HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org.">http://www.alsa-project.org.</A> The
ALSA drivers directly support multiplexing the dsp devices. The only
problem is they currently support fewer cards than the OSS drivers that
come with the Linux kernel. Check out the web page and see if your card is
supported. If it is, the best avenue would be replacing OSS with ALSA.

</P>
<P>
You can globally increase the volume of all waveforms generated by festival
by adding the following to your siteinit.scm. Put that in the festival/lib
directory, (where all the other .scm files are) probably
/usr/lib/festival/lib if you used the standard rpms. Add the following

<P>

This will maximises the volume within a wavefrom, this wont necessary make
all voices the same loudness (though it will be close).

You need to have the TCP/IP protocol enabled for your Networking Interface

TCP/IP enable for the dial up adaptor, but you need to seperately enable it

<P>
The people at <A HREF="http://www.x10.com">http://www.x10.com</A> sell
affordable devices that communicate with each other over normal household
power lines.  

</P>
<P>
The most common modules are the Lamp module and the Appliance module. Both
sell for around $10-$15. The lamp module has can turn up to 300 watt lamps
on, off, and various levels of bright. The appliance module is an on/off
relay.

</P>
<P>
The 2 most popular X10 PC interfaces are the <CODE>$50</CODE>
ActiveHome/CM11 and the <CODE>$6</CODE> Firecracker/CM17.

</P>
<P>
The CM17 is a transmit only interface. In addition to being almost free,
another advantage is it is wireless. It is a small, 1 inch box that just
dangles off of your serial port and transmits to a receiver that plugs into
the wall. The other advantage to the CM17 is gives instant ON/OFF control
to the relay built into the wireless receiver. All other X10 devices have
about a 1/2 second delay to send and receive the protocol over the power
lines.

</P>
<P>
The CM11 is a 2 way interface, so you can program mh events to react to X10
motion sensor and button pushes from various X10 controlers (e.g. keychain
and palmpads). Some of the newer, more expensive modules, like the
<CODE>$35</CODE> LM14A lamp module, allow you to query their status, so you
can determine it status even if it were manually turned on or off.

</P>
<P>
If decide you splurge for the CM11 activehome kit, you might as well also
get the Firecracker kit. For the extra $6, you also get a few extra modules
and mh can support both the CM11 and the CM17 on the same port. 

</P>
<P>
There is lots of great X10 info at <A
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana">http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana</A>
, including information on using and buying X10 hardward outside of the US.

</P>
<P>
Here is some more info, copied from a misterhouse-users post by Kevin
Olalde. 

</P>
<P>
The firecracker hardware, CM17 which plugs into the PC, can only send radio
frequency (RF) commands to devices. With the kit you will also get a
transceiver, TM751, that receives commands from the CM17 and relays
commands for the house code it's set to via your power lines. You also get
a lamp module, LM465, which can be control with via the transceiver. With
the PalmPad or the CM17 you send RF commands to the TM751, those commands
are then relayed to the lamp module (or other power line receiver modules,
like light switches). All of this is one way communications, the LM465 lamp
module and the TM751 transceiver are not capable of reporting status. The
TM751 doubles as an appliance module hard coded to unit 1. You can only
control it though RF commands, it does not respond to power pline commands.

</P>
<P>
The next step I took was to order the Active Home kit. With it you get
(among other stuff), another transceiver, RR501, and another computer
interface, CM11A. The RR501 works like the TM751, in that it receives RF
commands, and relays then on to the power line. A difference is that the
RR501 can report it's status. The computer interface, CM11A, can send power
line commands (you use computer software to tell the interface what
commands to send), 'sees' all commands being sent over the power line (and
reports those commands to computer software), and can ask modules for their
status. The RR501 also doubles as an appliance module, it can be set to
unit code 1 or 9, and can be controlled with both RF and power line
commands.

The majority of the devices, lamp modules, appliance modules, wall
switches, ..... are one way devices, they can only receive. I have no
historical perspective, but it looks as though that was the way the
original X10 spec went, one way only.

</P>
<P>
There are devices that can report their current status to something like
the CM11A, but I haven't used any of then (except for the RR501), since
that are much more expense.

Here is a post from Clay Jackson

</P>
<P>
Right now, I've got 3 sensors (DS1822, in the three-lead package, inside an
epoxy filled soda straw) at the end of 150' of Radio Shack ``flat'' cable,
talking to a DS9097U (the U is CRITICAL) with no problems. On the bench, I
had another 2 sensors on the end of a 50' cable (for a total of 5 sensors).
When I strung the 50' cable, I must have crimped a lead, because it now
meters ``closed'' and when it was plugged into the ``net'', I got no
readings.

</P>
<P>
I also have an HA5 from Point-Six; that I'm gonna play with soon. The code
Bruce did is for the 9097U, so that's why I started there (and, it's
cheaper). The 9097U has all the ``passive'' pull-up stuff the data sheets
talk about (courtesy of a DS2048 inside the DB9); so I'm hoping it will do
the trick. Anyway, I'll keep the list posted as things progress.

</P>
<P>
Bottom line - all I needed was Bruce's code, a 9097U from Dallas, the
sensors and some Radio Shack ``phone'' cable.

</P>
<P>
One more thing to watch - as best I can tell, Dallas has not standardized
their thermal devices with respect to their outputs. For example, the
DS1820 and DS1920 both return a 9 bit value that's basically an integer.
However, the DS1822 returns a VARIABLE length value (12 bits by default),
with a binary point between the 3rd and 4th digits. According to someone
else on the list, the ThermoCRON iButton is different yet again.
