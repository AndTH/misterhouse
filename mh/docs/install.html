<H2><I><a name=requirements>System Requirements</a></h2></B></I>

<p>Mister House has been tested on Windows 95, 98, NT, and the unix OSes Linux and AIX.  In theory, much
of the function should run on any platform that can run Perl.  

<p>The core Mister House code will use between 5 and 15 Megabytes of memory.
On Windows, the VR (Voice Recognition) function 
takes about 5 MB and the TTS (Text To Speech) function takes about 15 MB.  On Linux, the Festival TTS engine
takes about 20-30 MB of memory.  So, with TTS enabled, on Windows you can get by with 32 Meg, but you will 
need 48 Meg to run with low speech latency.

<p>The cpu time used -vs- loops per second is controllable.  On a 100 MHz Pentium with a 100 ms sleep time,
mh uses about 20% of the cpu and gets about 8 passes per second.


<H2><I><a name=quick_instructions>Quick Install Instructions</a></h2></B></I>

<P>These are the quick instructions for those of you who, like me, don't like to read instructions:</P>

<UL>
<li> Windows users

<UL>
<LI>Download the the mh_src_###.zip and mh_win_###.zip files from Mister House from: 
<A HREF="http://misterhouse.webjump.com">http://misterhouse.webjump.com</A> </LI>
<LI>cd to where you want it the mh directory created in (e.g. c:\)</LI>
<LI>unzip \downloads\mh_src_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to) </LI>
<LI>unzip \downloads\mh_win_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to) </LI>
<LI>cd mh\bin </LI>
<LI>mh.exe</LI>
</UL>

<li> Linux users

<UL>
<LI>Download the the mh_src_###.zip and mh_linux_###.zip files from Mister House from: 
<A HREF="http://misterhouse.webjump.com">http://misterhouse.webjump.com</A> </LI>
<LI>cd to where you want it the mh directory created in (e.g. cd /projects)</LI>
<LI>unzip -aU /downloads/mh_src_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to) </LI>
<LI>unzip -aU /downloads/mh_linux_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to) </LI>
<LI>cd mh/bin </LI>
<LI>chmod +x configure
<li>./configure
<li>./mhe (or if you have a recent perl, try running ./mh )
</UL>

</UL>


<P>This runs all the test scripts in the mh\code\test directory.  Point your web browser to 
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</A>
and try out a few commands.  Also try 'telnet localhost 1234' and type one of the commands you saw on the
web interface (e.g. 'say something good to Bruce').

<H2><I><a name=detailed_instructions>Detailed Install Instructions for Windows users</a></h2></B></I>

<H3><a name=step1>Step 1, Download and Install Mister House</a></h2></B>

<P>I you already have perl installed, you only need to download the main mh_src_###.zip package.  If you do not have perl
installed, you will also need to download the compiled mh.exe file, which is in the mh_win_###.zip package.
Both are available from <A HREF="http://misterhouse.webjump.com">http://misterhouse.webjump.com</A>.</P>

<P>The 1 MB mh_src_###.zip file installs into 3 MB of disk space. The mh_win_###.zip takes an additional 3 MB of disk space.  
The compiled version is not any faster, it is just more convenient
if you do not need Perl installed for any other programs.</p>

<P>Change to the drive/directory you want mh installed to (e.g. c:\), and unzip the file(s) using your un-zipper of choice
(use the -d if using pkunzip to preserve the directory structure).  Look in the mh/lib directory to 
make sure long file names were preserved (e.g. http_server.pl).  If not, you can download unzip from 
<a href="http://misterhouse.net/public/unzip.exe">http://misterhouse.net/public/unzip.exe</a>.

<H3><a name=step2>Step 2, Download and Install Perl</a></h3></B>

<P>You can skip this step if you downloaded the compiled version of Mister House.</P>

<P>Download and install Perl version 5.005_02 (or higher) from 
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl">http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl</A>.
The 5 MB zip file installs into about 15 MB of disk space. </P>

<P>After installing the core Perl package, you need to install the Tk package.  mh will run
without Tk, but the Tk gui interface gives it more function.
Activestate has provided ppm (Perl Package Manager), a nifty new way of automatically downloading
and installing packages. Do this by logging on to the internet and typing: </P>

<ul>
<li>cd \perl\bin (modify to match your directory)
<li>ppm install Tk
<li>ppm install DB_File
</ul>

<P>The Tk package is about 2 MB, so it will take a while. If you are behind a www proxy firewall, 
try setting the environment variable http_proxy=http://&lt;proxy-server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; </P>
<P>If you have problems installing the files with ppm over the internet, you can download the files 
and install them from local storage. For example, to install the Tk package: </P>

<UL>
<LI>download and unzip <A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips/Tk.zip">http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips/Tk.zip</A> to c:\temp</LI>
<LI>ppm install c:\temp\Tk.ppd </LI>
</UL>

<p>All other required packages should either be in the mh distribution or is now installed by default in the 
standard Activestate distribution.


<H3><a name=step3>Step 3, Download and Install the Speech Engines</a></h3></B>
</B><P>You can skip this step if you do not want to enable TTS and VR, but much of the fun of
Mister House comes from the 2-way speech. If you are running NT 5.0, you should be able to skip this step,
as this function should already be installed. The Creative Labs PhoneBlaster software also installs this function.</P>

<P>If you are running Win95, the Perl OLE interface to the MS speech engines
require that you have DCOM 1.2 or higher installed.
The DCOM 1.3 upgrade is 1.2 Meg and available at 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom95/dcom1_3.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom95/dcom1_3.asp</A>.</P>

<p>If you are running Win98, you will need the DCOM 1.3 update, available from:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom98/dcom1_3.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom98/dcom1_3.asp</A>.
If you don't have this update, mh will run, but you may occasionally see windows (like control pannel or install shield)
not start right away, especially if you run without the Tk interface (mh -tk 0).

<P>You can enable the speech functions either by installing the Speech SDK, or by installing the speech engines separately.

<h4>Installing the SKD</h4>
The current Microsoft Speech Developer Kit (SDK) is Version 4 and weighs in at about about 39 MB!
To download, go to 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/iit/download/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/iit/download/default.htm</a>
 and pick "Speech SDK 4.0 Suite". 
Make sure you pick the SUITE version. Since the file is large, you may want to use a program like
FileHound or GetRight that can resume interrupted downloads.</P>

<P>After downloading, simply run the file to install. The 4.0 SDK requires about 70 MB of disk space to install,
but after installation is complete, you can delete the "Microsoft Speech SDK" directory if you want to save disk space.
The files to enable VR and TTS engines are Installed elsewhere.</P>

<h4>Installing the speech engines separately</h4>

<P>With a little more work, you can save download time by installing just the engines, the speech API,
and the MSVoice application.  The TTS and VR engines from 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/IIT/download/speechengines.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/IIT/download/speechengines.htm</a>
(between 4 and 15 MB, depending on what and how many engines you pick).  The Speech API and MSVoice
application are available in <A HREF="http://misterhouse.net/public/speech_api.zip">speech_api.zip</A>.
To install the speech API, run the SPCHAPI.EXE file.  To install MSVoice, simply unzip MSVOICE.ZIP to a directory of your choice.</P>

<P> After the install, run the "Microsoft Voice" application (available the bottom of your Programs menu if you
installed the SDK). Once running, you can use the "Voice Command Options" menu to pick your default voice.</P>


<hr>

<H2><I><a name=detailed_instructions_u>Detailed Install Instructions for UNIX users</a></h2></B></I>

<H3><a name=step1_u>Step 1, Download and Install Mister House</a></h3></B>

<P>Download a 'Perl source' file mh_src_###.zip from 
<A HREF="http://misterhouse.webjump.com">http://misterhouse.webjump.com</A>.</P>

<P>The 1 MB zip file installs into 3 MB of disk space.

<p>If you are running on linux and you do not have perl with the latest Tk installed, 
you may also want to download the linux compiled version, mhe, which is in the mh_linux_###.zip package.

<P>Change to the directory you want mh installed to (e.g. /projects) and unzip the file(s) using your un-zipper of choice
(use the -d if using pkunzip to preserve the directory structure).   If using 'unzip', you 
will want to use the -a to Automatically get rid of those pesky /r characters that DOS like to add to newlines
Also, the unzip -U switch (contrary to what the help text says), will be needed on newer versions of unzip to preserve case on filenames. 

<p>Run the configure script to delete dos/windows only files, and 'chmod +x' on the files in the bin directory.

<H3><a name=step2_u>Step 2, Download and Compile Perl</a></h3></B>

<p>If you are on linux and have also downloaded mhe from mh_linux_###.zip, you can skip this step.

<P>Most, if not all, UNIX installations now have perl installed by default.  If for some reason, yours does not
or if it is an older version of perl, you can downloaded the latest from 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com">http://www.perl.com</A>.

<p>Run 'perl -v' to show your version ... anything above 5.005 should be fine. 
The current Redhat 5.2 version of Linux comes with 5.004.  This works OK, but we have had some problems 
compiling the current Tk interface with 5.004, so you may want to upgraded to 5.005.

<p>If you want to use
the Tk interface (used to display logs and various pop-up messages), make sure that the perl Tk package is installed as well.
If the Tk is not installed, this test will fail:  perl -e "use Tk".   If you need it, you can download perl Tk from 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</A>.  If you can
also try the CPAN installer like this:

<ul>
<li> >su root
<li> >perl -MCPAN -eshell
<li>  cpan> install Tk
<li>  cpan> install DB_File
<li>  cpan> exit
</ul>


<H3><a name=step3_u>Step 3, Download and Install a Speech Engines</a></h3></B>
</B><P>You can skip this step if you do not want to enable VR or TTS.

<p>The IBM ViaVoice Voice Recognition engine is available at
<a href=http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/sdk_linux.html>http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/sdk_linux.html</a>
Currently the only download available is a large 80 MB tar file, the bulk of which is used for the VR dictation
engine that we do not need.  The installed/expanded files require about 120 MB of space.
Hopefully a smaller package with just the Command and Control engine will become available at some point.

<p>After downloading, install viavoice by running (as root) run tar -xf viavoice_sdk_rtk_2.tar and then  
follow the tar file readme.txt instructions.  Note for our usage, you will not need
any of the gui menus, so if rpm tells you that you have down level or missing libraries (e.g. libgdk),
you can probably ignore that by adding the tar --nodeps option.

<p>As the readme.txt instructions state, you should probably run the viavoice code as non-root.
Here is one way to allow non-root access to the microphone:

<ul>
<li>chmod go+rw /dev/dsp*
<li>chmod go+rw /dev/audio*
</ul>

<p>The viavoice SDK FAQ can be found here at
a href=http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/faq_linux.html>http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/faq_linux.html</a>.
It includes suggestion on what to do if you get rc=90 when you start viavoice_server.
The faq also covers how you can move training files and non-English from the (non-free) windows version.

<p>After running the rpm commands, you can find other documentation in 
/usr/doc/Viavoice.  Section 2 of the skreadme.txt file details how to 
create a speech and entrollment ids.  Here is an example of the commands
that I used (as user id bruce, not root):

<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/ViaVoice/bin/vvuseradm -newuser -userid bruce
<li>/usr/lib/ViaVoice/bin/vvuseradm -newenrollid -userid bruce -enrollid bruceid
<li>/usr/lib/ViaVoice/bin/vvuseradm -userid bruce -enrollid bruceid -setdefault
</ul>

<p>Lastly, run the /usr/bin/audiog program (requires motif or lesstif from lesstif.org to be installed)
to set volume and recording levels, and viavoice is installed.
You may want to also use a program like xmixer to select what the sound source is if, for example,
you want to monitor the line input instead of or in addition to the mike input.

<p>To enable viavoice from mh, set the viavoice parms in the mh.ini file, run mh/bin/viavoice_server_start, then 
start mh.

<p>The IBM ViaVoice Outload TTS engine for Linux can also be downloaded from the above IBM sdk url.
To use it with mh, enable the vvo_server mh.ini parms and download the vvo_server code from
<a hrev=http://dittos.penguinpowered.com/automation/index.html#software>http://dittos.penguinpowered.com/automation/index.html#software

<p>The Festival Speech engine is available from
<a href=http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/download.html>http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/download.html</a>
There are various voices and languages available.  Also, they have Linux binaries there, if for whatever reason, you 
have problems compiling the source code.

<p>Once you have downloaded in and installed or compiled Festival, you can test it with the following commands:
<ul>
<li> echo 'Hello from Festival' | festival --tts 
<li> festival --server &
<li> echo '(SayText "Hello from the festival client")' | festival_client
</ul>

<p>You can also run the client, or a simple telnet, from a different box, but you first have to create 
a /usr/lib/festival/lib/siteinit.scm  file with a list of boxes that you want to give authority to.  (e.g. 
(set! server_access_list '("localhost" "house\\.isl\\.net"))  ).  See the festival documentation for more details.

<p>David L. reports that there is a different engine for festival called MBROLA at
<a href=http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html>http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html</a>
that has a very nice US english male and female voice.

<p>Once you have the festival server running, you can enable mh to use it with mh.ini parms voice_text and festival_port.

<hr>

<H2><I><a name=testing>Testing Mister House</a></h2></B></I>

</B><P>Edit x:\mh\bin\mh.ini and change the appropriate parms.   It should run just fine with the 
default parms,  although your sunrise/sunset times will be for Rochester, MN
:)
<p>If you decide to keep/use mh, you will probably want to copy the parms you
change to your own parm file and point to that with the mh_parm environmental
variable (see the mh.ini header for details).

<P>If you are not using the compiled mh.exe, edit the last record of the mh.bat file to point to the correct
directories where Perl and the mh are installed. </P>

<P>Next, cd to x:\mh\bin and then type: mh hello_print.pl. This will load the x:\mh\code\test\hello_print.pl
file which is a simple event that prints some uptime info every 30 seconds.
Since we did not include the tk*.pl members, the tk interface will not be displayed</P>

<P>From the console window, hit the ENTER key to bring up a control menu, 
then select the "Exit menu" item to exit.  Or use Ctl-C.

<P>Next, if you have installed the speech engines, try the hello_speak.pl event (e.g. mh hello_speak.pl). 
This will speak the time and date once a minute. It also creates one VR command.

If you are a Windows user and have the VR engine installed, make sure
the green MSVoice V icon is in the "Listening for Voice Commands" mode, try saying, "What time is it?"
You can list all the available commands by right clicking on the V and picking "What can I say?"

<P>To run all of the sample code in the test directory, do not specify any files (e.g. just type mh).
Here are a few of the commands enabled by files in the test directory:
<ul>
<li>"What is the trivia question?" and "What is the triva answer?"
<li>"Read the deep thought"
<li>"Say something bad to Bruce"
<li>"Say something good to Bruce"
<li>"Set a timer for 5 minutes"
<li>"Set a timer for 30 seconds"
<li>"Show disk space"
<li>"When will the sun set"
<li>"How do you pronounce MisterHouse"   ... this a 'play' on Linux :)
</ul>

<P> If you are logged onto the internet, you can try these commands:
<ul>
<li>"Set the clock via the internet" to set your computer's clock according to an atomic clock
<li>To send a test email to yourself, try "Send test email".  This requires that you fill out the net_mail 
parms in the mh.ini file.
<li>To retrieve and display the latest top 10 list from Letterman's Late Night show, try "Get the top 10 list"
</ul>

<P>You can control any of your serial, X10, and voice items with a frames capable web browser by pointing
it to <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</A> . Note, the port number is controllable
via mh.ini http_port parm. If you do not have any other web server running, you may want to change it
from the default of 8080 to 80 so that you can use a simpler address of <A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost</A> .</P>

<p>You can also tailor the web interface to your liking by creating a new member in the \mh\web\mh directory and changing
the html_file mh.ini parm.  For example, you can preview an alternate interfaces with
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/mh_brian/index_2.html">mh_brian/index_2.html</A>, or
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/mh_brian/index_3.html">mh_brian/index_3.html</A>

<p>Windows users can also setup a Windows Active Desktop entry so this interface is available all the time on your desktop!

<P>In addition to the voice and web interfaces, you can type these commands on the Tk "Enter Command" field
or from the DOS command line using the house command.
For example, from a DOS command prompt, try typing:  'house Show the top 10 list'
You can also speak or display any arbitrary phrase or file with the commands
"Display file" or "Speak phrase" (e.g. 'house speak hi there').   These commands are simple bat files that create 
commands in the "xcmd_file", whose location is controlled with a mh.ini parm.  You can have your own program put commands
in this file as well.  Lastly, you can type all these commands via a telnet localhost session or via a socket port, if you have the telnet.pl
member enabled.

<p>Here is a summary of the different ways you can control mh:
<ul>
<li>With a voice command
<li>Through a web browser and whatever html you want to set up.
<li>By typing a command on the Tk Control Window
<li>By typing "house command" from a dos box
<li>By having whatever program you want create a command in the xcmd_file
<li>By a TCP socket, for example, using telnet localhost
</ul>

<P>Use your favorite editor to review and try some changes to any or all test members. On the Mister House
window, use the F1 key to re-load your changed code. If you introduced an error, it will sound a long beep,
spit out some errata showing the error, and then it re-loads the old error-free code.
There is lots of other code you can peruse in the mh\code\Bruce directory. This is all the code that runs our house!</P>

<hr>

<H2><I><a name=hardware>Installing Hardware</a></h2></B></I>
</B><P>Without any interface hardware, mh is pretty limited. It can do some simple time of day based events
 and voice based events, but that is about it. Currently, Mister House
 supports the X10 CM11 (aka ActiveHome) and CM17 (aka Firecracker) 
interfaces and all the Weeder kits (analog, digital, x10, phone, available from from 
<A HREF="http://www.weedtech.com/">http://www.weedtech.com</A> ).  Support for the JDS/HomeBase line is currently be debugged.  The code is written,
but I don't have the interface, so I'm waiting for someone to try it.</P>

<P>Currently, the X10 guys have a $50 deal for an ActiveHome kit, which includes the CM11 interface.
 Check it out at <A HREF="http://www.x10.com/">http://www.x10.com</A>.</P>

<P>If you want more than just X10, you may want to go with the Weeder X10 Kit, as all of the Weeder kits
 can share the same serial port. The X10 kit sells for $40, $25 for a WT523 module (if you don't already have that),
 $10 for a serial and a phone cable, and about an hour with a soldering iron. </P>

<P>After plugging in the Weeder X10 kit or a CM11 interface into a free serial port, update the 
Weeder_port or cm11_port parm in the mh.ini file to point to that port and try a simple example, like test_x10.pl in the test directory. </P>

<P>Support for any serial port device can be coded by using the generic Serial_Item objects. 
For example, a ham radio enthusiast has interfaced to his GPS (Global Positioning Satellite)  to keep track of his car's location 
(see his tracking.pl code in the code/Public directory)</P>

<P>Support for any device that speaks with sockets over your network can be added using the Socket_Item objects.
