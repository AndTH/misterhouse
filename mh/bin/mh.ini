#
#        Configuration variables for MisterHouse programs
#
# Change log is at the bottom
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Rather than edit this file, create your own 'mh.private.ini' file
#      and override just the values you need to.  Then set the mh_parms
#      environment variable to point to this file.  By default it will look 
#      for it in mh/bin/mh.private.ini.
#
#         Examples on how to set environment parms:
#
#           On Windows systems, add this to your autoexec.bat
#               set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.ini
#
#           Or set up a bat file with something like this:
#              
#              set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.ini
#              c:
#              cd \misterhouse\bin
#              mh
#
#
#           On linux systems, add this to your /etc/profile:
#               export mh_parms=/prog/Misterhouse/mh.ini
#
#
#      The idea with mh_parms was to allow you to put your private parms in a
#      directory seperate from the main mh distorbution, so you could easily point
#      to and upgrade to different mh versions.  Here is what I have:
#
#         /misterhouse/mh.ini (has just a the few entries I changed)
#         /misterhouse/bruce  (my code)
#         /misterhouse/data   (my data)
#         /misterhouse/mh     (the mh distro)
#
#      See the 'Coding your own event' section of mh/docs/install.html for 
#      more info
#
#      By changing the following parms, you can keep the mh distribution files
#      separate from your local files (makes upgrades easier):
#        - code_dir
#        - data_dir
#        - html_dir
#
#      You can also override any of these parameters from the command 
#      line.  For example:
#
#          mh -code_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_code
#             -data_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_data
#             -html_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_web
#

#------
# Point to the html file that is used for the web interface.
# - html_dir     points to the default dir (i.e. what you get with 
#                http://localhost:8080/)
# - html_default points to the member names used when the URL points to a 
#                directory.
# - html_alias*  points to other directories that are not subdirectories of 
#                html_dir
# - html_style*  points to the Style sheets used to control fonts/colors
#
# - See \mh\web\mh\mh.html, section 'Customizing the Web Interface' for more 
# documentation

# Note: As with many mh parms, if you want to quickly try most of the following
# you can use the mh reload button/function, then refresh your webpage. You do 
# not have to exit mh.

# These password options control access to mh functions over the intra/internet
#
# - password_file is the place you want to keep your encrypted password.  
# Default is data_dir/.password.  Use mh/bin/set_password to create the file.
# If this file does not exist (i.e. you have not run set_password)
# the web server, telnet.pl, and mhsend will allow full access to everyone.
#
# - password_allow_file is used to list commands and/or items that can be
#   controlled without password protection (e.g. demo/harmless commands).
#
# - password_allow_clients is the (comma delimited) list of ip addresses of 
#   clients you want to bypass password protection from (e.g. boxes on your 
#   intranet).  Can be a regular expressions.  For example:
#      10\.0\.0\.[^1]  allows for all 10.0.0.* address except 10.0.0.1
#      127\.0\.0\.1,^200\.200\.200  matches localhost and 200.200.200.* 
#
#
# - password_protect controls what requires a password to be displayed.
#    Possible values are:
#    all -> All of the web pages (i.e. nothing will be displayed without a 
#    password)
#    log -> The web speak and print logs.
#    widgets -> All of the widgets.
#    vars -> The Global and Save variables.
#    none -> Same as blank.  Anyone can look at all of the web pages
#    (they still will need a password for control).

# Location data
# - sunrise/set items need lat/long.  
# lat/long example: 44 degrees 30 minutes -> 44.5
# - city, state, and country  are for internet weather data.
#------
# You can use http://www.mapblast.com to verify latitude and longitude
# Here is a map our neighborhood:

# Satalite view available via:  
#   http://terraserver.microsoft.com
# 
# The time_zone parm is the difference between GMT (Greenich Mean Time -- 
# London) and your local time.  If running Windows, you can find the value in 
# the the Clock Tray Time Zone.
# You can also pick it off a map time zone data at:
# http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/faq/docs/world_tzones.html
# Use positve numbers for time_zone and for longitude 
# Time Zone examples:
#  - Sydney       ->  10  (-34 151)
#  - Cairo        ->   2
#  - London       ->   0
#  - Buenos Aires ->   3
#  - USA Eastern  ->   5
#  - USA Pasific  ->   8
# After making changes here, you can run sun_time from the command line to 
# test and verify with data from:
# http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/data/docs/RS_OneYear.html
#
# Note: If you have the TZ enviroment variable set, that will override this

#seasons=Summer,Autumn,Winter,Spring        # Southern hemisphere


# The $Holiday variable is set on any comma-delimited dates listed here.  
# - $Holiday is set to the description string following the date (e.g. New Year)
# - If the description is not specified, $Holiday is set to 1 (e.g. 1/1, 12/25)
# Need a clever way to find changing dates like:
#  Memorial day:  Last Monday in May
#  Labor    day:  First Monday in September
#  Thanksging  :  Last Thursday in November

# http_port:
#    Use 80 if you want to use the normal web port (i.e. http://localhost)
#    If using something other than 80 (because you already have a web server

#----
# server options
#  - Used if you want mister_house to service TCP/IP socket calls from
#    other clients.  For an example, see code/test/telnet.pl.  Set to blank to 
#    disable.
#    Specify as many servers as needed.  server_name_port (_name is a # or any 
#    arbitrary string)
#
#  - Options are:
#       port     -> The socket port number. 
#       echo     -> If 1, the data received is echoed back to the sender
#       protocol -> TCP or UDP; default TCP if not specified.
#
#       datatype options:
#           records  -> data is split on \n (cr).  The 'said' method
#                       will return data only when a new line has been
#                       completely read.  This is the default.
#           buffered -> data is read with <>, one line per pass
#                       This allows clients to read more data with handle 
                        $port (e.g. mhsend_server.pl)
#           raw      -> data is not split.  The 'said' method returns
#                       whatever has been read into the buffer when called.

# voice command options
#  - Used if you want Mister House to do voice recognition and voice synthesis. 
#    See the mh/docs/install.html on how to install various speech engines.
#
#  - voice_text can be MS, festival, vvo_speak (for IBM's viavoice Outloud)
#    or any combination of the three (e.g. festival,vvo_speak).  Set to blank 
#    to disable.
#
#  - voice_cmd  can be MS, viavoice, or blank to disable
#
#  - pronouncable_list_file:    List of words to forcibly pronounce

#                               the last command was heard.  Then it switches 
#                               to asleep mode. Set to 0 or blank to disable 
#                               (always stay in awake mode). 
#
#    - viavoice_asleep_phrase:  Command{s} to put mh into asleep mode.
#    - viavoice_asleep_response:This is what it said (or played) when entering

# serial_ports
#  - points to the serial ports for various interfaces
#  - set to blank to disable
#  - on Windows, use COM1, COM2, ... COMn 
#       Note:  On Windows NT and Windows 2000, for ports > 9, prefix with \\.\
#              See article Q115831 at http://search.support.microsoft.com/kb
#         For example:    cm11_port=\\.\COM10
#
#  - on linux, use /dev/ttyS0 for COM1, /dev/ttyS1 for COM2, etc.
#  -  Note: To allow the port to be written to by any user id, run this command
#     as root:
#               chmod o+w /dev/ttyS0
#
#  - Port names can be one of the following:
#       weeder_port
#       cm11_port (For X10 ActiveHome interface)
#       cm17_port (For X10 Firecracker interface)
#       HomeBase_port
#       serial#_port (# is 1 .. whatever)
#  - For generic serial#_ports:
