Upgrading from pervious versions:
---------------------------------

The easiest way to upgrade from a previous version is:

1. Make a backup copy of all .tab and .cfg files

2. Install the new version in the directory of your choice

3. Replace all .tab files with your backup copies


The next step depends on how much custom configuration you
have done to the scripts.  The easiest thing to do is 
simply run the Setup utility and make any adjustments to
the configuration.

If you have done a lot of special configuration, and
you do not want to redo all settings from scratch, then you
can optionally replace all .cfg files with your backup
copies.  You will then need to run the setup utility to
specify the correct location of images.  The first method
is easier and more reliable, though.
